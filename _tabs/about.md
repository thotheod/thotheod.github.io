Hey there, tech enthusiasts! Welcome to my blog. I'm based in Athens, Greece, and by day, I work as a Cloud Solution Architect on Microsoft's Cloud Architecture and Engineering team, helping businesses navigate the cloud. When I'm not doing that, I'm a family guy with twin boys. But let's talk about the fun stuff â€“ I'm all about tech, from Kubernetes to Containers to the latest innovations in Azure. Outside the digital world, you'll find me cruising on my motorcycle, capturing life's moments through my camera lens, and hitting the trails on my mountain bike. Oh, and I'm a bit of a foodie too, always on the hunt for the perfect dish to pair with a great beer.
